                <p>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental concepts in computer science that help you organize and store data efficiently and solve problems effectively. Here’s a brief overview:
Data Structures
Data structures are ways to organize and store data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Common data structures include:

Arrays: A collection of elements identified by index or key.
Linked Lists: A sequence of elements where each element points to the next.
Stacks: A collection of elements that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
Queues: A collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
Trees: A hierarchical structure with a root element and sub-elements.
Graphs: A set of nodes connected by edges.
Algorithms
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. Key types of algorithms include.....

                <p>Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses “objects” to design applications and programs. Here are the key concepts:
Core Concepts of OOP
Classes and Objects:
Class: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a datatype by bundling data and methods that work on the data.
Object: An instance of a class. It is created using the class blueprint and can have unique values for its properties.
Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) together as a single unit. It restricts direct access to some of the object’s components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data.
Inheritance:
Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behavior (methods) from an existing class. This helps in code reusability and establishing a relationship between classes.
Polymorphism:
Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. It can be achieved through method overloading (same method name with different parameters) and method overriding (redefining a method in a derived class).
Abstraction:
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.
